# How to replace standard menus with my own?


<p><br />
This example demonstrates how you can display a custom form instead of default popup menus for DevExpress controls. Most of our components provide the MenuManager property of the IDXMenuManager  type. All you need to do is to implement a custom component that supports this interface. Two main benefits of this approach:<br />
1. You do not need to handle any event. <br />
2. You do not need to create menu items manually. You just need to convert the provided items according to your logic.</p>
